AWS Network Logic (Python)
This repository contains small Python utilities that simulate AWS‑style network reasoning.

The goal is to demonstrate the ability to:
parse AWS‑like JSON
find objects by ID
evaluate routing logic
simulate Transit Gateway reachability
write clean, testable Python functions

These patterns match real AWS networking tasks such as:
checking if two subnets can communicate
determining TGW attachment relationships
evaluating route table entries
validating network paths

Contents:
data/sample_topology.json — Example AWS‑style topology
src/find_by_id.py — Utility to find objects in lists
src/reachability.py — Logic to determine subnet‑to‑subnet reachability
src/tgw_logic.py — Transit Gateway attachment evaluation

Skills Demonstrated:
Python (loops, conditions, dicts, lists)
JSON parsing
AWS networking concepts (VPC, Subnets, TGW, Route Tables)
Network automation mindset
Clean code structure

How to run:
python3 src/reachability.py
